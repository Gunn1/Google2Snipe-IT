# Google ChromeOS to Snipe-IT Sync

This script automates the process of syncing ChromeOS device data from the **Google Admin SDK** into your **Snipe-IT** asset inventory.

It fetches device data using a Google service account with domain-wide delegation and pushes it to Snipe-IT. Duplicate devices are automatically updated. All activity is logged and a progress bar shows sync status.
